# Locutus 
Locutus provides the backend for a web based terminology mapping tool in the very early stages of development. The goal of the application is to provide a collaborative environment to harmonize dataset terms with public ontologies such as MeSH, HPO and others. 

There isn't much here at this time, but there are some example data based on a real research data-dictionary along with standard CRUD functionality. 

Some example queries: 

Terminologies: 
* https://locutus-l2xv5td7oq-uc.a.run.app/api/Terminology 
* https://locutus-l2xv5td7oq-uc.a.run.app/api/Terminology/tm-DCQHVrWz6DEW5HOVoeJus (for a particular id)

Table: 
* https://locutus-l2xv5td7oq-uc.a.run.app/api/Table 
* https://locutus-l2xv5td7oq-uc.a.run.app/api/Table/INCLUDE:participant

Study: 
* https://locutus-l2xv5td7oq-uc.a.run.app/api/Study (you can query by ID as well, but since there is only one...)
  
DataDictionary:
